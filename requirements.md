## Vision

What is the vision of this product?

- The vision for this product is an interactive customizable web resume generator for devs by devs. This will include an interface that will seemlessly and dynamically transition from section to section displaying the user's professional information in the order that they prefer. This product will also include visuals and custom colors so the resume isn't bland and hard to get through. 

What pain point does this project solve?

- The pain point this project solves is for a couple main audiences, the job seeker, the hiring manager and recruiters. This will solve the strenuous and tedious process of going through monotonous resume after resume. With a dynamic and interactive resume, job seekers can show their personalities and hiring personnel are able to have fun going through a resume.

Why should we care about your product?

- You should care about this product because of what it can do for you as a job seeker. Every Resume has the same similar format, and that is great for the ATS filtering systems and for the computers to go through. But when your resume gets into the hands of an actual person, it will stand out if it's fun and interactive. It allows job seekers to stand out and the person on the other side to save their sanity and strain going through resumes.
